# Living in fantasy land
 - Matz started working in 1990... very different world, first months of analysis, then months of documentation, only then coding... very conservative.
 - Dependent on bad assumptions
	- We know what we make...
		- In reality, we don't know what we need to make until we make it
		- software is not restricted by physical constraints, so can get exponentially complex
		- in the end, only the code describes what we make
	- We know what we want
		- in reality, clients don't really know what they want either
		- we can't know what we really need to bring success, it's not clients or bosses who are stupid, it's just unknowable without testing.
 - We have bad forecasts...
 - We ignore our ignorance
 - Red queen race in our situation - run as fast as we can just to stay in place.
 - Ostrich algorithm - Ignore everything and hope problem goes away by itself

## Our goal these days is to create great software.
 - Software development is cheaper, 
	- we have better tools, 
	- better languages, 
	- far more open source libraries... 
	- better collaboration tools (When Matz first started, he was forbidden to write emails outside of japan)
	- things are getting better.
 - we are standing on shoulders of giants.
 - we can program with joy... 
 - enterprise software was so boring... heh, Matz has same problems as we do...
 - so instead he writes a language to express the joy :)

## Who maintains the fantasy land?
 - we can't ignore the existing mess...
 - without garbage collectors, we will be buried in crap
 - appreciate the people who write the gems, the books, the frameworks, the libraries...
 - key to successful open source community is appreciation and respect...
 - the community has to keep moving forward, or die
 - try often, fail early, keep moving forward.
 - appreciation is not enough... creation is required
 - "I am not a great programmer... I introduce soooo many bugs... but I still was able to change the world" - Matz
 - so go change the world :)
